      <h1>Incremental Method / Jarvis March for Convex Hull</h1>
      <p>The gift wrapping algorithm begins with i=0 and a point p0 known to be on the convex hull, e.g., the leftmost point, and selects the point pi+1 such that all points are to the right of the line pi pi+1. This point may be found in O(n) time by comparing polar angles of all points with respect to point pi taken for the center of polar coordinates. Letting i=i+1, and repeating with until one reaches ph=p0 again yields the convex hull in h steps. In two dimensions, the gift wrapping algorithm is similar to the process of winding a string (or wrapping paper) around the set of points. <br><br></p>
